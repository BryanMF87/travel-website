# Travel Website

## Project Description
I took a layered PSD mockup and built a fully responsive website with an extendable information accordion and a repeating card carousel component. The goal was to pick a complex website mock up to recreate so I could challenge my coding skills, and to make a desktop layout mobile friendly.

## Project Challeges
I choose this layout for its complex layout, interactive components, and difficult design elements. It was also an interesting challenge to create a mobile layout from the desktop view and deciding which elements to keep, which ones to edit, and how they would interact on a mobile screen size.


## Project Lessons
During this project I learned static site generation from Gatsby Js and styled components. Learning about Gatsby helped me gain a basic understanding of the difference between server-side generation vs client-side generation and when to use each. Styled components started off as a rather laborous effort to style my app, but now that I am use to it, styled components are probably my new favorite method of styling.
